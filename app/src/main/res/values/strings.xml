<b>Background Information</b>\n
This workout is based on Jason Blaha\'s ice cream fitness 5x5 also known as ICF or ICF5x5. It\'s extremely popular because
it increases strength very quickly. It\'s designed for novices and it has many many testimonials online, which prove its
effectiveness. You can read all about it here: https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/jason-blaha-ice-cream-fitness-
5x5-novice-workout if you\'re interested and you can Google it to see the accolades. (I know it says not to change anything.
The changes made are minimal, because we will be doing the workout only once / week and cable crunches are awkward as
hell.).  This is hypertrophy lifting, which means lifting high weights (not body weight) in low reps.\n\n
